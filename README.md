## Exam: critical presentation
Each student will be evaluated (score 0-10) for their participation in class (10%) and for a their final project (90%), to be done in teams. 
All students in a team (max 4) will be asked to do a short presentation (20 mins + 10 mins QA) as a final project about one or more papers or past projects from their research experience. 
Every presentation shall critically discuss the proposed paper/project under the light of what has been presented in the course.

### What to discuss
Possible aspects to highlight and discuss in your presentation include

- which probabilistic reasoning task is tackled?
- what is challenging w.r.t. reasoning and learning?
- which step of the reasoning pipeline is tractable? (and why?)
- which step is intractable instead? (and why? can it be made tractable?)
- can you improve tractability and/or quality of the approximations?


### Forming teams
Tell Antonio who your team is, by the end of lecture #2.

### (Possible) papers to present
Each team can select one or more papers from the list below, propose a paper that is not in the list, or simply present some unpublished work.
